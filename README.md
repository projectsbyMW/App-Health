# App-Health
<h3> A script that checks an app's heath.</h3>
Wrote a script that can check the uptime of an application and determine if it is functioning correctly or not. The script accurately assesses the application's status by checking HTTP status codes. It detects if the application is 'up', meaning it is functioning correctly, or 'down', indicating that it is unavailable or not responding.
